# mini-ani

mini-ani is a recommendation system for anime shows.

Users can add their watched anime or import from MAL or AniList. Their recommendations will be personalized based on the shows they watch using a recommendation algorithm.

The user interface also provides highly customizable recommendations (exclude genres, shows, etc.), allowing for better recommendations.
